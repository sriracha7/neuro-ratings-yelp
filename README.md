# neuro-ratings_yelp

An exploratory beginner deep learning project to predict Yelp star ratings from review text, implemented in a Google Colab notebook through Neuromatch Academy.

## Description

This project uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures to analyze and predict star ratings of Yelp reviews. It includes pre-trained Word2Vec and GloVe word embeddings and a balanced dataset for model training.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the Google Colab notebook.

### Prerequisites

**Google Account:** You will need a Google account to access Google Colab.

### Running the Notebook

1. **Open the Colab Notebook:**

   Click the link below to open the Google Colab notebook:

   [Neuro Ratings Yelp Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eCPvUtJC89L4MZ7PqjJLm9BnPYgm2YqN?usp=sharing)

  Or just access it through the main branch in the repository by cloning the repository.

2. **Downloading the Word Embeddings**

   The word embedding files (Word2Vec and GloVe) were too large to upload normally to the github repository so here are the external links      to download them:

   [GloVe](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielwillgeorge/glove6b100dtxt?resource=download)
   [Word2Vec](https://github.com/eyaler/word2vec-slim)
   
4. **Install Dependencies:**

   In the notebook, there is a section at the beginning that installs all the necessary dependencies. You donâ€™t need to do anything additional; just run that section.

## Everything should work from there.
